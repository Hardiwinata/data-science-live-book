> "The voice of the numbers" -- a metaphor by [Eduardo Galeano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Galeano). Writer and novelist.

The data we explore could be like Egyptian hieroglyphs without a correct interpretation. Profiling is the very first step in a series of iterative stages in the pursuit of finding what the data want to tell us, if we are patient enough to listen. 

This chapter will cover, with a few functions, a complete data profiling. This should be the entry step in a data project, where we start by knowing the correct data types and exploring distributions in numerical and categorical variables.

It also focuses on the extraction of semantic conclusions, which is useful when writing a report for non-technical people.

Functions summary review in the chapter:

* `df_status(data)`: Profiling dataset structure
* `describe(data)`:  Numerical and categorical profiling (quantitative)
* `freq(data)`: Categorical profiling (quantitative and plot).
* `profiling_num(data)`: Profiling for numerical variables (quantitative)
* `plot_num(data)`: Profiling for numerical variables (plots)

Note: `describe` is in the `Hmisc` package while remaining functions are in `funModeling.`


<br>

### Dataset health status {#dataset-health-status}

The quantity of zeros, NA, Inf, unique values as well as the data type may lead to a good or bad model. Here's an approach to cover the very first step in data modeling. 

First, we load the `funModeling` and `dplyr` libraries.

```{r, results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Loading funModeling!
library(funModeling)
library(dplyr)
data(heart_disease)
```

#### Checking missing values, zeros, data type, and unique values

Probably one of the first steps, when we get a new dataset to analyze, is to know if there are missing values (`NA` in **R**) and the data type.

The `df_status` function coming in `funModeling` can help us by showing these numbers in relative and percentage values. It also retrieves the infinite and zeros statistics.


```{r df-status, eval=FALSE}
# Profiling the data input
df_status(heart_disease)
```

```{r profiling-data-in-r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Dataset health status", out.extra=""}
knitr::include_graphics("exploratory_data_analysis/dataset_profiling.png")
```



* `q_zeros`: quantity of zeros (`p_zeros`: in percent)
* `q_inf`:  quantity of infinite values (`p_inf`: in percent)
* `q_na`:  quantity of NA (`p_na`: in percent)
* `type`: factor or numeric
* `unique`: quantity of unique values

#### Why are these metrics important?

* **Zeros**: Variables with **lots of zeros** may not be useful for modeling and, in some cases, they may dramatically bias the model.
* **NA**: Several models automatically exclude rows with NA (**random forest** for example). As a result, the final model can be biased due to several missing rows because of only one variable. For example, if the data contains only one out of 100 variables with 90% of NAs, the model will be training with only 10% of the original rows.
* **Inf**: Infinite values may lead to an unexpected behavior in some functions in R.
* **Type**: Some variables are encoded as numbers, but they are codes or categories and the models **don't handle them** in the same way.
* **Unique**: Factor/categorical variables with a high number of different values (~30) tend to do overfitting if the categories have low cardinality (**decision trees,** for example).


<br>


#### Filtering unwanted cases

The function `df_status` takes a data frame and returns a _status table_ that can help us quickly remove features (or variables) based on all the metrics described in the last section. For example:


**Removing variables with a _high number_ of zeros**

```{r profiling-data}
# Profiling the Data Input
my_data_status=df_status(heart_disease, print_results = F)

# Removing variables with 60% of zero values
vars_to_remove=filter(my_data_status, p_zeros > 60)  %>% .$variable
vars_to_remove

# Keeping all columns except the ones present in 'vars_to_remove' vector
heart_disease_2=select(heart_disease, -one_of(vars_to_remove))
```


**Ordering data by percentage of zeros**

```{r profiling-data-2}
arrange(my_data_status, -p_zeros) %>% select(variable, q_zeros, p_zeros)
```

<br>

The same reasoning applies when we want to remove (or keep) those variables above or below a certain threshold. Please check the missing values chapter to get more information about the implications when dealing with variables containing missing values.

<br>

#### Going deep into these topics

Values returned by `df_status` are deeply covered in other chapters:

* **Missing values** (NA) treatment, analysis, and imputation are deeply covered in the [Missing Data](#missing_data) chapter.
* **Data type**, its conversions and implications when handling different data types and more are covered in the [Data Types](#data_types) chapter.
* A high number of **unique values** is synonymous for  high-cardinality variables. This situation is studied in both chapters:
    + [High Cardinality Variable in Descriptive Stats](#high_cardinality_descriptive_stats)
    + [High Cardinality Variable in Predictive Modeling](#high_cardinality_predictive_modeling)
    
<br>

#### Getting other common statistics: **total rows**, **total columns** and **column names**:

```{r}
# Total rows
nrow(heart_disease)

# Total columns
ncol(heart_disease)

# Column names
colnames(heart_disease)
```

<br>

### Profiling categorical variables {#profiling-categorical-variables}

_Make sure you have the latest 'funModeling' version (>= 1.6)._

Frequency or distribution analysis is made simple by the `freq` function. This retrieves the distribution in a table and a plot (by default) and shows the distribution of absolute and relative numbers.

If you want the distribution for two variables: 

```{r frequency-analysis-r, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, fig.cap=c('Frequency analysis 1','Frequency analysis 2'), out.extra = ""}
freq(data=heart_disease, input = c('thal','chest_pain'))
```

As well as in the remaining `funModeling` functions, if `input` is missing, then it will run for all factor or character variables present in a given data frame:

```{r profiling-categorical-variable-4, eval=F}
freq(data=heart_disease)
```
 

If we only want to print the table excluding the plot, then we set the `plot` parameter to `FALSE`.
The `freq` example can also handle a **single variable** as an input. 
By _default_, `NA` values **are considered** in both the table and the plot. If it is needed to exclude the `NA` then set `na.rm = TRUE`.
Both examples in the following line: 

```{r profiling-categorical-variable-5, eval=F}
freq(data=heart_disease$thal, plot = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE)
```

If only one variable is provided, then `freq` returns the printed table; thus, it is easy to perform some calculations based on the variables it provides. 

* For example, to print the categories that represent most of the 80% of the share (based on `cumulative_perc < 80`). 
* To get the categories belonging to the **long tail**, i.e., filtering by `percentage < 1` by retrieving those categories appearing less than 1% of the time.

In addition, as with the other plot functions in the package, if there is a need to export plots, then add the `path_out` parameter, which will create the folder if it's not yet created.

```{r, eval=F}
freq(data=heart_disease, path_out='my_folder')
```

##### Analysis

The output is ordered by the `frequency` variable, which quickly analyzes the most frequent categories and how many shares they represent (`cummulative_perc` variable). In general terms, we as human beings like order. If the variables are not ordered, then our eyes start moving over all the bars to do the comparison and our brains place each bar in relation to the other bars.

Check the difference for the same data input, first without order and then with order:


```{r univariate-analysis, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Order and beauty", out.extra = ''}
knitr::include_graphics("exploratory_data_analysis/profiling_text_variable-bw.png")
```

Generally, there are just a few categories that appear most of the time. 

A more complete analysis is in [High Cardinality Variable in Descriptive Stats](#high_cardinality_descriptive_stats)


<br>

#### Introducing the `describe` function

This function comes in the `Hmisc` package and allows us to quickly profile a complete dataset for both numerical and categorical variables. In this case, we'll select only two variables and we will analyze the result.

```{r}
# Just keeping two variables to use in this example
heart_disease_3=select(heart_disease, thal, chest_pain)

# Profiling the data!
describe(heart_disease_3)
```

Where: 

* `n`: quantity of non-`NA` rows. In this case, it indicates there are `301` patients containing a number.
* `missing`: number of missing values. Summing this indicator to `n` gives us the total number of rows.
* `unique`: number of unique (or distinct) values.

The other information is pretty similar to the `freq` function and returns between parentheses the total number in relative and absolute values for each different category.

<br>

### Profiling numerical variables

This section is separated into two parts:

* Part 1: Introducing the “World Data” case study
* Part 2: Doing the numerical profiling in R

If you don’t want to know how the data preparation stage from Data World is calculated, then you can jump to "Part 2: Doing the numerical profiling in R", when the profiling started.

#### Part 1: Introducing the World Data case study

This contains many indicators regarding world development. Regardless the profiling example, the idea is to provide a ready-to-use table for sociologists, researchers, etc. interested in analyzing this kind of data.

The original data source is: [http://databank.worldbank.org](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&Topic=11#). There you will find a data dictionary that explains all the variables.

First, we have to do some data wrangling. We are going to keep with the newest value per indicator.

```{r}
library(Hmisc)

# Loading data from the book repository without altering the format
data_world=read.csv(file = "https://goo.gl/2TrDgN", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F, na.strings = "..")

# Excluding missing values in Series.Code. The data downloaded from the web page contains four lines with "free-text" at the bottom of the file.
data_world=filter(data_world, Series.Code!="")

# The magical function that keeps the newest values for each metric. If you're not familiar with R, then skip it.
max_ix<-function(d) 
{
  ix=which(!is.na(d))
  res=ifelse(length(ix)==0, NA, d[max(ix)])
  return(res)
}

data_world$newest_value=apply(data_world[,5:ncol(data_world)], 1, FUN=max_ix)

# Printing the first three rows
head(data_world, 3)
```

The columns `Series.Name` and `Series.Code` are the indicators to be analyzed. 
`Country.Name` and `Country.Code` are the countries. Each row represents a unique combination of country and indicator. 
Remaining columns, `X1990..YR1990.` (year 1990),`X2000..YR2000.` (year 2000), `X2007..YR2007.` (year 2007), and so on indicate the metric value for that year, thus each column is a year. 

<br>


#### Making a data scientist decision

There are many `NAs` because some countries don't have the measure of the indicator in those years. At this point, we need to **make a decision** as a data scientist. Probably no the optimal if we don’t ask to an expert, e.g., a sociologist.

What to do with the `NA` values? In this case, we are going to to keep with the **newest value** for all the indicators. Perhaps this is not the best way to extract conclusions for a paper as we are going to compare some countries with information up to 2016 while other countries will be updated only to 2009. To compare all the indicators with the newest data is a valid approach for the first analysis.

Another solution could have been to keep with the newest value, but only if this number belongs to the last five years. This would reduce the number of countries to analyze. 

These questions are impossible to answer for an _artificial intelligence system_, yet the decision can change the results dramatically.

**The last transformation**

The next step will convert the last table from _long_ to _wide_ format. In other words, each row will represent a country and each column an indicator (thanks to the last transformation that has the _newest value_ for each combination of indicator-country).

The indicator names are unclear, so we will "translate" a few of them.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# Get the list of indicator descriptions.
names=unique(select(data_world, Series.Name, Series.Code))
head(names, 5)

# Convert a few
df_conv_world=data.frame(
  new_name=c("urban_poverty_headcount", 
             "rural_poverty_headcount", 
             "gini_index", 
             "pop_living_slums",
             "poverty_headcount_1.9"), 
  Series.Code=c("SI.POV.URHC", 
                "SI.POV.RUHC",
                "SI.POV.GINI",
                "EN.POP.SLUM.UR.ZS",
                "SI.POV.DDAY"), 
  stringsAsFactors = F)

# adding the new indicator value
data_world_2 = left_join(data_world, 
                         df_conv_world, 
                         by="Series.Code", 
                         all.x=T)

data_world_2 = 
  mutate(data_world_2, Series.Code_2=
           ifelse(!is.na(new_name), 
                  as.character(data_world_2$new_name), 
                  data_world_2$Series.Code)
         )
```

Any indicator meaning can be checked in data.worldbank.org. For example, if we want to know what `EN.POP.SLUM.UR.ZS` means, then we type: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.SLUM.UR.ZS


```{r, warning=FALSE}
# The package 'reshape2' contains both 'dcast' and 'melt' functions
library(reshape2)

data_world_wide=dcast(data_world_2, Country.Name  ~ Series.Code_2, value.var = "newest_value")
```

Note: To understand more about `long` and `wide` format using `reshape2` package, and how to convert from one to another, please go to http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape.html.

Now we have the final table to analyze:

```{r}
# Printing the first three rows
head(data_world_wide, 3)
```


<br>

#### Part 2: Doing the numerical profiling in R {#numerical-profiling-in-r}

We will see the following functions:

* `describe` from `Hmisc`
* `profiling_num` (full univariate analysis), and `plot_num` (hisotgrams) from `funModeling`


We'll pick up only two variables as an example:

```{r}
library(Hmisc) # contains the `describe` function

vars_to_profile=c("gini_index", "poverty_headcount_1.9")
data_subset=select(data_world_wide, one_of(vars_to_profile))

# Using the `describe` on a complete dataset. # It can be run with one variable; for example, describe(data_subset$poverty_headcount_1.9)

describe(data_subset)
```


Taking `poverty_headcount_1.9` (_Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day is the percentage of the population living on less than $1.90 a day at 2011 international prices._), we can describe it as:

* `n`: quantity of non-`NA` rows. In this case, it indicates `116` countries that contain a number.
* `missing`: number of missing values. Summing this indicator to `n` gives us the total number of rows. Almost half of the countries have no data.
* `unique`: number of unique (or distinct) values.
* `Info`: an estimator of the amount of information present in the variable and not important at this point.
* `Mean`: the classical mean or average.
* Numbers: `.05`, `.10`, `.25`, `.50`, `.75`, `.90` and `.95 ` stand for the percentiles. These values are really useful since it helps us to describe the distribution. It will be deeply covered later on, i.e., `.05` is the 5th percentile.
* `lowest` and `highest`: the five lowest/highest values. Here, we can spot outliers and data errors. For example, if the variable represents a percentage, then it cannot contain negative values.

<br>

The next function is `profiling_num` which takes a data frame and retrieves a _big_ table, easy to get overwhelmed in a _sea of metrics_. This is similar to what we can see in the movie _The Matrix_.


```{r matrix-movie, out.width="150px", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The matrix of data", out.extra = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("exploratory_data_analysis/matrix_movie.png")
```

_Picture from the movie: "The Matrix" (1999). The Wachowski Brothers (Directors)._



The idea of the following table is to give to the user a **full set of metrics,**, for then, she or he can decide which ones to pick for the study.

Note: Every metric has a lot of statistical theory behind it. Here we'll be covering just a tiny and **oversimplified** approach to introduce the concepts. 


```{r}
library(funModeling)

# Full numerical profiling in one function automatically excludes non-numerical variables
profiling_num(data_world_wide)
```

Each indicator has _its raison d'être_:

* `variable`: variable name

* `mean`: the well-known mean or average

* `std_dev`: standard deviation, a measure of **dispersion** or **spread** around the mean value. A value around `0` means almost no variation (thus, it seems more like a constant); on the other side, it is harder to set what _high_ is, but we can tell that the higher the variation the greater the spread. 
_Chaos may look like infinite standard variation_. The unit is the same as the mean so that it can be compared.

* `variation_coef`: variation coefficient=`std_dev`/`mean`. Because the `std_dev` is an absolute number, it's good to have an indicator that puts it in a relative number, comparing the `std_dev` against the `mean` A value of `0.22` indicates the `std_dev` is 22% of the `mean` If it were close to `0` then the variable tends to be more centered around the mean. If we compare two classifiers, then we may prefer the one with less `std_dev` and `variation_coef` on its accuracy.

* `p_01`,    `p_05`,    `p_25`,    `p_50`,    `p_75`,    `p_95`,    `p_99`: **Percentiles** at 1%, 5%, 25%, and so on. Later on in this chapter is a complete review about percentiles.

For a full explanation about percentiles, please go to: [Annex 1: The magic of percentiles](#appendix-percentiles).

* `skewness`: is a measure of _asymmetry_. Close to **0** indicates that the distribution is _equally_ distributed (or symmetrical) around its mean. A **positive number** implies a long tail on the right, whereas a **negative number** means the opposite.
After this section, check the skewness in the plots. The variable `pop_living_slums` is close to 0 ("equally" distributed), `poverty_headcount_1.9` is positive (tail on the right), and `SI.DST.04TH.20` is negative (tail on the left). The further the skewness is from 0 the more likely the distribution is to have **outliers** 

* `kurtosis`: describes the distribution **tails**; keeping it simple, a higher number may indicate the presence of outliers (just as we'll see later for the variable `SI.POV.URGP` holding an outlier around the value `50`
For a complete skewness and kurtosis review, check Refs. [@skew_kurt_1] and [@skew_kurt_2].

* `iqr`:  the inter-quartile range is the result of looking at percentiles `0.25` and `0.75` and indicates, in the same variable unit, the dispersion length of 50% of the values. The higher the value the more sparse the variable.

* `range_98` and `range_80`: indicates the range where `98%` of the values are. It removes the bottom and top 1% (thus, the `98%` number). It is good to know the variable range without potential outliers. For example, `pop_living_slums` goes from `0` to `76.15` It's **more robust** than comparing the **min** and **max** values. 
The `range_80` is the same as the `range_98` but without the bottom and top `10%`

`iqr`, `range_98` and `range_80` are based on percentiles, which we'll be covering later in this chapter.

**Important**: All the metrics are calculated having removed the `NA` values. Otherwise, the table would be filled with NA`s.

<br>

##### Advice when using `profiling_num`

The idea of `profiling_num` is to provide to the data scientist with a full set of metrics, so they can select the most relevant. This can easily be done using the `select` function from the `dplyr` package. 

In addition, we have to set in `profiling_num` the parameter `print_results = FALSE`. This way we avoid the printing in the console.

For example, let's get with the `mean`,  `p_01`,  `p_99` and `range_80`:

```{r}
my_profiling_table=profiling_num(data_world_wide, print_results = FALSE) %>% select(variable, mean, p_01, p_99, range_80)

# Printing only the first three rows
head(my_profiling_table, 3)
```

Please note that `profiling_num` returns a table, so we can quickly filter cases given on the conditions we set.

<br> 

##### Profiling numerical variables by plotting {#plotting-numerical-variable}

Another function in `funModeling` is `plot_num` which takes a dataset and plots the distribution of every numerical variable while automatically excluding the non-numerical ones:

```{r, profiling-numerical-variable-with-histograms, fig.cap="Profiling numerical data", out.extra = ''}
plot_num(data_world_wide)
```

We can adjust the number of bars used in the plot by changing the `bins` parameter (default value is set to 10). For example: `plot_num(data_world_wide, bins = 20)`.


---

<br>

### Final thoughts
 
Many numbers have appeared here so far, _and even more in the percentile appendix_. The important point is for you to find the right approach to explore your data. This can come from other metrics or other criteria.

The functions `df_status`,  `describe`, `freq`, `profiling_num` and `plot_num` can be run at the beginning of a data project.

Regarding the **normal and abnormal behavior** on data, it's important to study both. To describe the dataset in general terms, we should exclude the extreme values: for example, with `range_98` variable. The mean should decrease after the exclusion.

These analyses are **univariate**; that is, they do not take into account other variables (**multivariate** analysis). This will be part of this book later on. Meanwhile, for the correlation between input (and output) variables, you can check the [Correlation](#correlation) chapter.

## Correlation and Relationship {#correlation}

```

<br>

### What is this about?

This chapter contains both methodological and practical aspects of measuring correlation in variables. We will see that _correlation_ word can be translated into "**functional relationship**".

In methodological you will find the Anscombe Quartet, a set of four plots with dissimilar spatial distribution, but sharing the same correlation measure. We'll go one step ahead re-calculating their relationship though a more robust metric (MIC).

We will mention **Information Theory** several times, although by now it's not going to be covered at the mathematical level, it's planned to. Many algorithms are based on it, even deep learning.

Understanding these concepts in low dimension (two variables) and small data (a bunch of rows) allow us to better understand high dimensional data. Nonetheless, some real cases are only _small_ data.

From the practical point of view, you'll be able to replicate the analysis with your own data, profiling and exposing their relationships in fancy plots.


<br>


Let's starting loading all needed libraries.

```{r lib, message=F, results="hide", warning=FALSE}
# Loading needed libraries
library(funModeling) # contains heart_disease data
library(minerva) # contains MIC statistic
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2) 
library(gridExtra) # allow us to plot two plots in a row
options(scipen=999) # disable scientific notation
```
<br>

### Linear correlation {#linear-correlation}

Perhaps the most standard correlation measure for numeric variables is the `R statistic` (or Pearson coefficient) which goes from `1` _positive correlation_ to `-1` _negative correlation_. A value around `0` implies no correlation.

Consider the following example, which calculates R measure based on a target variable (for example to do feature engineering). Function `correlation_table` retrieves R  metric for all numeric variables skipping the categorical/nominal ones.

```{r}
correlation_table(data=heart_disease, target="has_heart_disease")
```
Variable `heart_disease_severity` is the most important -numerical- variable, the higher its value the higher the chances of having a heart disease (positive correlation). Just the opposite to `max_heart_rate`, which has a negative correlation.

Squaring this number returns the `R-squared` statistic (aka `R2`), which goes from `0` _no correlation_ to `1` _high correlation_. 

R statistic is highly influenced by **outliers** and **non-linear** relationships.

<br>

#### Correlation on Anscombe's Quartet

Take a look at the **Anscombe's quartet**, quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet):

> They were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe to demonstrate both the importance of graphing data before analyzing it and the effect of outliers on statistical properties. 

1973 and still valid, fantastic.

These four relationships are different, but all of them have the same R2: `0.816`.

Following example calculates the R2 and plot every pair.

```{r anscombe-data, message=FALSE, tidy=FALSE, fig.cap="Anscombe set", out.extra = ''}
# Reading anscombe quartet data
anscombe_data = 
  read.delim(file="https://goo.gl/mVLz5L", header = T)

# calculating the correlation (R squared, or R2) for 
#every pair, every value is the same: 0.86.
cor_1 = cor(anscombe_data$x1, anscombe_data$y1)
cor_2 = cor(anscombe_data$x2, anscombe_data$y2)
cor_3 = cor(anscombe_data$x3, anscombe_data$y3)
cor_4 = cor(anscombe_data$x4, anscombe_data$y4)

# defining the function
plot_anscombe <- function(x, y, value, type)
{
  # 'anscombe_data' is a global variable, this is 
  # a bad programming practice ;)
  p=ggplot(anscombe_data, aes_string(x,y))  + 
    geom_smooth(method='lm', fill=NA) + 
    geom_point(aes(colour=factor(1), 
                   fill = factor(1)), 
               shape=21, size = 2
               ) + 
    ylim(2, 13) +

             nrow=2)
```

4-different plots, having the same `mean` for every `x` and `y` variable (9 and 7.501 respectively), and the same degree of correlation. You can check all the measures by typing `summary(anscombe_data)`. 

This is why is so important to plot relationships when analyzing correlations.

We'll back on this data later. It can be improved! First, we'll introduce some concepts of information theory.

<br>

### Correlation based on Information Theory

This relationships can be measure better with [Information Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) concepts. One of the many algorithms to measure correlation based on this is: **MINE**, acronym for: Maximal Information-based nonparametric exploration.

The implementation in R can be found in [minerva](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/minerva/index.html) package. It's also available in other languages like Python.

<br>

#### An example in R: A perfect relationship

Let's plot a non-linear relationship, directly based on a function (negative exponential), and print the MIC value.

```{r mic-non-linear-relationship, message=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3, fig.cap="A perfect relationship", out.extra = ''}
x=seq(0, 20, length.out=500)
df_exp=data.frame(x=x, y=dexp(x, rate=0.65))
ggplot(df_exp, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_line(color='steelblue') + theme_minimal()

# position [1,2] contains the correlation of both variables, excluding the correlation measure of each variable against itself.

# Calculating linear correlation
res_cor_R2=cor(df_exp)[1,2]^2
sprintf("R2: %s", round(res_cor_R2,2))

# now computing the MIC metric
res_mine=mine(df_exp)
sprintf("MIC: %s", res_mine$MIC[1,2])
```

**MIC** value goes from 0 to 1. Being 0 implies no correlation and 1 highest correlation. The interpretation is the same as the R-squared.

<br>

#### Results analysis 

The `MIC=1` indicates there is a perfect correlation between the two variables. If we were doing **feature engineering** this variable should be included.

Further than a simple correlation, what the MIC says is: "Hey these two variables show a functional relationship". 

In machine learning terms (and oversimplifying): "variable `y` is dependant of variable `x` and a function -that we don't know which one- can be found model the relationship."

This is tricky because that relationship was effectively created based on a function, an exponential one.

But let's continue with other examples...

<br>

### Adding noise

Noise is an undesired signal adding to the original one. In machine learning noise helps the model to get confused. Concretely: two identical input cases -for example customers- have different outcomes -one buy and the other doesn't-.

Now we are going to add some noise creating the `y_noise_1` variable.

```{r noisy-relationship, fig.width=4, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Adding some noise", out.extra = ''}
df_exp$y_noise_1=jitter(df_exp$y, factor = 1000, amount = NULL)
ggplot(df_exp, aes(x=x, y=y_noise_1)) + 
  geom_line(color='steelblue') + theme_minimal()
```

Calculating the correlation and MIC again, printing in both cases the entire matrix, which shows the correlation/MIC metric of each input variable against all the others including themselves.

```{r}
# calculating R squared
res_R2=cor(df_exp)^2
res_R2

# Calculating mine
res_mine_2=mine(df_exp)

# Printing MIC 
res_mine_2$MIC

```

Adding noise to the data decreases the MIC value from 1 to 0.7226365 (-27%), and this is great!

R2 also decreased but just a little bit, from 0.3899148 to 0.3866319 (-0.8%). 

**Conclusion:** MIC reflects a noisy relationship much better than R2, and it's helpful to find correlated associations. 

**About the last example:** Generate data based on a function is only for teaching purposes. But the concept of noise in variables is quite common in _almost_ **every data set**, no matter its source. You don't have to do anything to add noise to variables, it's already there.
Machine learning models deal with this noise, by approaching to the _real_ shape of data.

It's quite useful to use the MIC measure to get a sense of the information present in a relationship between two variables.

<br>

### Measuring non-linearity (MIC-R2)

`mine` function returns several metrics, we checked only **MIC**, but due to the nature of the algorithm (you can check the original paper [@ReshefEtAl2011]), it computes more interesting indicators. Check them all by inspecting `res_mine_2` object.

One of them is `MICR2`, used as a measure of **non-linearity**. It is calculated by doing the: MIC - R2. Since R2 measures the linearity, a high `MICR2` would indicate a non-linear relationship.

We can check it by calculating the MICR2 manually, following two matrix returns the same result:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# MIC r2: non-linearity metric
round(res_mine_2$MICR2, 3)
# calculating MIC r2 manually
round(res_mine_2$MIC-res_R2, 3)
```

Non-linear relationships are harder to build a model, even more using a linear algorithm like decision trees or linear regression. 

Imagine we need to explain the relationship to another person, we'll need "more words" to do it. It's easier to say: _"A increases as B increases and the ratio is always 3x"_ (if A=1 then B=3, linear). 

In comparison to: _"A increases as B increases, but A is almost 0 until B reaches the value 10, then A raises to 300; and when B reaches 15, A goes to 1000."_

```{r measuring-non-linearity, message=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3, tidy=FALSE, fig.cap="Comparing relationships", out.extra = ''}
# creating data example
df_example=data.frame(x=df_exp$x, 
                      y_exp=df_exp$y, 
                      y_linear=3*df_exp$x+2)

# getting mine metrics
res_mine_3=mine(df_example)

# generating labels to print the results
results_linear = 
  sprintf("MIC: %s \n MIC-R2 (non-linearity): %s",
          res_mine_3$MIC[1,3],
          round(res_mine_3$MICR2[1,3],2)
          )

results_exp = 
  sprintf("MIC: %s \n MIC-R2 (non-linearity): %s", 
          res_mine_3$MIC[1,2],
          round(res_mine_3$MICR2[1,2],4)
          )

# Plotting results 
# Creating plot exponential variable
p_exp=ggplot(df_example, aes(x=x, y=y_exp)) + 
  geom_line(color='steelblue') + 
  annotate("text", x = 11, y =0.4, label = results_exp) + 
  theme_minimal()

# Creating plot linear variable
p_linear=ggplot(df_example, aes(x=x, y=y_linear)) + 
  geom_line(color='steelblue') + 
  annotate("text", x = 8, y = 55, 
           label = results_linear) + 
  theme_minimal()

grid.arrange(p_exp,p_linear,ncol=2)
```

<br>

Both plots show a perfect correlation (or relationship), holding an MIC=1.
Regarding non-linearity, MICR2 behaves as expected, in `y_exp`=0.6101, and in `y_linear`=0. 

This point is important since the **MIC behaves like R2 does in linear relationships**, plus it adapts quite well to **non-linear** relationships as we saw before, retrieving a particular score metric (`MICR2`) to profile the relationship. 

<br>

### Measuring information on Anscombe Quartet

Remember the example we review at the beginning? Every pair of Anscombe Quartet returns a **R2 of 0.86**. But based on its plots it was clearly that not every pair exhibits neither a good correlation nor a similar distribution of `x` and `y`.

But what happen if we measure the relationship with a metric based on Information Theory? Yes, MIC again.

```{r anscombe-set-information, fig.cap="MIC statistic", out.extra = ''}
# calculating the MIC for every pair
mic_1=mine(anscombe_data$x1, anscombe_data$y1, alpha=0.8)$MIC
mic_2=mine(anscombe_data$x2, anscombe_data$y2, alpha=0.8)$MIC
mic_3=mine(anscombe_data$x3, anscombe_data$y3, alpha=0.8)$MIC
mic_4=mine(anscombe_data$x4, anscombe_data$y4, alpha=0.8)$MIC

# plotting MIC in a 2x2 grid
grid.arrange(plot_anscombe("x1", "y1", mic_1, "MIC"), plot_anscombe("x2", "y2", mic_2,"MIC"), plot_anscombe("x3", "y3", mic_3,"MIC"), plot_anscombe("x4", "y4", mic_4,"MIC"), ncol=2, nrow=2)

```

As you may notice we increased the `alpha` value to 0.8, this is a good practice -according to the documentation- when we analyzed small samples. The default value is 0.6 and its maximum 1.

In this case, MIC value spotted the most spurious relationship in the pair `x4 - y4`. Probably due to a few cases per plot (11 rows) the MIC was the same for all the others pairs. Having more cases will show different MIC values.

But when combining the MIC with **MIC-R2** (non-linearity measurement) new insights appears:

```{r anscombe-set}
# Calculating the MIC for every pair, note the "MIC-R2" object has the hyphen when the input are two vectors, unlike when it takes a data frame which is "MICR2".
mic_r2_1=mine(anscombe_data$x1, anscombe_data$y1, alpha = 0.8)$`MIC-R2`
mic_r2_2=mine(anscombe_data$x2, anscombe_data$y2, alpha = 0.8)$`MIC-R2`
mic_r2_3=mine(anscombe_data$x3, anscombe_data$y3, alpha = 0.8)$`MIC-R2`
mic_r2_4=mine(anscombe_data$x4, anscombe_data$y4, alpha = 0.8)$`MIC-R2`

# Ordering according mic_r2
df_mic_r2=data.frame(pair=c(1,2,3,4), mic_r2=c(mic_r2_1,mic_r2_2,mic_r2_3,mic_r2_4)) %>% arrange(-mic_r2)
df_mic_r2
```


Ordering decreasingly by its **non-linearity** the results are consisent with the plots: 2 > 3 > 1 > 4.
Something strange for pair 4, a negative number. This is because MIC is lower than the R2. A relationship that worth to be plotted.

<br>

### Measuring non-monotonicity: MAS measure

MINE can also help us to profile time series regarding its non-monotonicity with **MAS** (maximum asymmetry score).

A monotonic series is such it never changes its tendency, it always goes up or down. More on this on [@monotonic_function].

Following example simulates two-time series, one not-monotonic `y_1` and the other monotonic `y_2`.

```{r monotonic-non-monotonic-function, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=8, tidy=FALSE, fig.cap="Monotonicity in functions", out.extra = ''}
# creating sample data (simulating time series)
time_x=sort(runif(n=1000, min=0, max=1))
y_1=4*(time_x-0.5)^2
y_2=4*(time_x-0.5)^3

# Calculating MAS for both series
mas_y1=round(mine(time_x,y_1)$MAS,2)
mas_y2=mine(time_x,y_2)$MAS

# Putting all together
df_mono=data.frame(time_x=time_x, y_1=y_1, y_2=y_2)

# Plotting
label_p_y_1 = 
  sprintf("MAS=%s (goes down \n and up => not-monotonic)", 
          mas_y1)

p_y_1=ggplot(df_mono, aes(x=time_x, y=y_1)) + 
  geom_line(color='steelblue') + 
  theme_minimal()  + 
  annotate("text", x = 0.45, y =0.75, 
           label = label_p_y_1)

label_p_y_2=
  sprintf("MAS=%s (goes up => monotonic)", mas_y2)

p_y_2=ggplot(df_mono, aes(x=time_x, y=y_2)) + 
  geom_line(color='steelblue') + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  annotate("text", x = 0.43, y =0.35, 
           label = label_p_y_2)

grid.arrange(p_y_1,p_y_2,ncol=2)

```

<br>

From another perspective, MAS is also useful to detect periodic relationships. Let's illustrate this with an example

```{r periodical-function, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=8, tidy=FALSE, fig.cap="Periodicity in functions", out.extra = '', echo=FALSE}

# creating data for non-periodic function
x_per=seq(-2*pi,2*pi,0.2)
df_per=data.frame(x=x_per, y=sin(2*x_per))

# creating data for periodic function
x_non_per=1:100
df_non_per=data.frame(x=x_non_per, y=2*x_non_per*x_non_per+2)

# Calculating MAS for both series
mas_y1_b=mine(df_per$x,df_per$y)$MAS
mas_y2_b=round(mine(df_non_per$x,df_non_per$y)$MAS,2)

# Plotting
p_y_1_b=ggplot(df_per, aes(x=x, y=y)) + 
  geom_line(color='steelblue') + 
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle(sprintf("MAS=%s (periodic)", round(mas_y1_b,2)))

p_y_2_b=ggplot(df_non_per, aes(x=x, y=y)) + 
  geom_line(color='steelblue') + 
  theme_minimal()  + 
  ggtitle(sprintf("MAS=%s (non-periodic)", mas_y2_b))

grid.arrange(p_y_1_b, p_y_2_b, ncol=2)
```

#### A more real example: Time Series

Consider the following case which contains three-time series: `y1`, `y2` and `y3`. They can be profiled concerning its non-monotonicity or overall growth trend.

```{r correlation-time-series, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, tidy=FALSE, fig.cap="Time series example", out.extra = ''}
# reading data
df_time_series = 
  read.delim(file="https://goo.gl/QDUjfd")

# converting to long format so they can be plotted
df_time_series_long=melt(df_time_series, id="time")

# Plotting
plot_time_series = 
  ggplot(data=df_time_series_long,
         aes(x=time, y=value, colour=variable)) +
  geom_line() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Set2")

plot_time_series
```

```{r}
# Calculating and printing MAS values for time series data
mine_ts=mine(df_time_series)
mine_ts$MAS 
```

<br>

We need to look at `time` column, so we've got the MAS value of each series regarding the time.
`y2` is the most monotonic (and less periodic) series, and it can be confirmed by looking at it. It seems to be always up.

**MAS summary:**

* MAS ~ 0 indicates monotonic or non-periodic function ("always" up or down)
* MAS ~ 1 indicates non-monotonic or periodic function 


<br>

### Correlation between time series

MIC metric can also measure the **correlation in time series**, it is not a general purpose tool but can be helpful to compare different series quickly.

This section is based on the same data we used in MAS example.

```{r time-series, fig.width=4, fig.height=2.5, fig.cap="Time series example", out.extra = ''}
# printing again the 3-time series
plot_time_series
# Printing MIC values
mine_ts$MIC

```
<br>

Now we need to look at `y1` column. According to MIC measure, we can confirm the same that it's shown in last plot: 

`y1` is more similar to `y3` (MIC=0.709) than what is `y2` (MIC=0.61). 

<br>

#### Going further: Dynamic Time Warping

MIC will not be helpful for more complex esenarios having time series which vary in speed, you would use [dynamic time warping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping) technique (**DTW**).

Let's use an image to catch up the concept visually:


```{r Dynamic-Time-warping, echo=FALSE, out.width="300px", fig.cap="Dynamic time warping", out.extra = ''}
knitr::include_graphics("exploratory_data_analysis/dynamic_time_warping.png")
```


Image source: _Dynamic time wrapping Converting images into time series for data mining_ [@img_time_series].

The last image shows two different approaches to compare time series, and the **euclidean** is more similar to MIC measure. While DTW can track similarities occurring at different times.

A nice implementation in **R**: [dtw package](http://dtw.r-forge.r-project.org).

Finding correlations between time series is another way of performing **time series clustering**.

<br>

### Correlation on categorical variables

MINE -and many other algorithms- only work with numerical data. We need to do a **data preparation** trick, converting every categorical variable into flag (or dummy variable).

If the original categorical variable has 30 possible values, it will result in 30 new columns holding the value `0` or `1`, when `1` represents the presence of that category in the row.

If we use package `caret` from R, this conversion only takes two lines of code:

```{r dummy-vars, message=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(caret)

# selecting just a few variables
heart_disease_2 = 
  select(heart_disease, max_heart_rate, oldpeak, 
         thal, chest_pain,exer_angina, has_heart_disease)

# this conversion from categorical to a numeric is merely 
# to have a cleaner plot
heart_disease_2$has_heart_disease=
  ifelse(heart_disease_2$has_heart_disease=="yes", 1, 0)

# it converts all categorical variables (factor and 
# character for R) into numerical variables.
# skipping the original so the data is ready to use
dmy = dummyVars(" ~ .", data = heart_disease_2)

heart_disease_3 = 
  data.frame(predict(dmy, newdata = heart_disease_2))

# Important: If you recieve this message 
# `Error: Missing values present in input variable 'x'. 
# Consider using use = 'pairwise.complete.obs'.` 
# is because data has missing values.
# Please don't omit NA without an impact analysis first, 
# in this case it is not important. 
heart_disease_4=na.omit(heart_disease_3)
  
# compute the mic!
mine_res_hd=mine(heart_disease_4)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
detach("package:caret")
```

Printing a sample...

```{r}
mine_res_hd$MIC[1:5,1:5]
```

Where column `thal.3` takes a value of 1 when `thal=3`.

<br>

#### Printing some fancy plots! 

We'll use `corrplot` package in R which can plot a `cor` object (classical correlation matrix), or any other matrix. We will plot **MIC** matrix in this case, but any other can be used as well, for example, **MAS** or another metric that returns an squared matrix of correlations.

The two plots are based on the same data but display the correlation in different ways. 

```{r correlation-information-theory, tidy=FALSE, fig.cap="Correlation plot", out.extra = ''}
# library wto plot that matrix
library(corrplot) 
# to use the color pallete brewer.pal
library(RColorBrewer) 

# hack to visualize the maximum value of the 
# scale excluding the diagonal (variable against itself)
diag(mine_res_hd$MIC)=0

# Correlation plot with circles. 
corrplot(mine_res_hd$MIC, 
         method="circle",
         col=brewer.pal(n=10, name="PuOr"),
         # only display upper diagonal
         type="lower", 
         #label color, size and rotation
         tl.col="red",
         tl.cex = 0.9, 
         tl.srt=90, 
         # dont print diagonal (var against itself)
         diag=FALSE, 
         # accept a any matrix, mic in this case 
         #(not a correlation element)
         is.corr = F 
        
)


# Correlation plot with color and correlation MIC
corrplot(mine_res_hd$MIC, 
         method="color",
         type="lower", 
         number.cex=0.7,
         # Add coefficient of correlation
         addCoef.col = "black", 
         tl.col="red", 
         tl.srt=90, 
         tl.cex = 0.9,
         diag=FALSE, 
         is.corr = F 
)

```

Just change the first parameter -`mine_res_hd$MIC`- to the matrix you want and reuse with your data. 

<br>

#### A comment about this kind of plots

They are useful only when the number of variables are not big. Or if you perform a variable selection first, keeping in mind that every variable should be numerical. 

If there is some categorical variable in the selection you can convert it into numerical first and inspect the relationship between the variables, thus sneak peak how certain values in categorical variables are more related to certain outcomes, like in this case.

<br>

#### How about some insights from the plots?

Since the variable to predict is `has_heart_disease`, it appears something interesting, to have a heart disease is more correlated to `thal=3` than to value `thal=6`.

Same analysis for variable `chest_pain`, a value of 4 is more dangerous than a value of 1.

And we can check it with other plot:

```{r profiling-target-variable, fig.height=2, fig.width=3, fig.cap="Visual analysis using cross-plot", out.extra = ''}
cross_plot(heart_disease, input = "chest_pain", target = "has_heart_disease", plot_type = "percentual")
```

The likelihood of having a heart disease is 72.9% if the patient has `chest_pain=4`. More than 2x more likely if she/(he) has `chest_pain=1` (72.9 vs 30.4%).

<br>

**Some thoughts...**

The data is the same, but the approach to browse it is different. The same goes when we are creating a predictive model, the input data in the _N-dimensional_ space can be approached through different models like support vector machine, a random forest, etc. 

Like a photographer shooting from different angles, or different cameras. The object is always the same, but the perspective gives different information.

Combining raw tables plus different plots gives us a more real and complementary object perspective.

<br>

### Correlation analysis based on information theory {#selecting_best_vars_mic}

Based on MIC measure, mine function can receive the index of the column to predict (or to get all the correlations against only one variable).

```{r importance-variable-ranking, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5, tidy=FALSE, fig.cap="Correlation using information theory", out.extra=''}

# Getting the index of the variable to 
# predict: has_heart_disease
target="has_heart_disease"
index_target=grep(target, colnames(heart_disease_4))

# master takes the index column number to calculate all
# the correlations
mic_predictive=mine(heart_disease_4, 
                    master = index_target)$MIC

# creating the data frame containing the results, 
# ordering descently by its correlation and excluding
# the correlation of target vs itself
df_predictive = 
  data.frame(variable=rownames(mic_predictive), 
                         mic=mic_predictive[,1], 
                         stringsAsFactors = F) %>% 
  arrange(-mic) %>% 
  filter(variable!=target)

# creating a colorful plot showing importance variable
# based on MIC measure
ggplot(df_predictive, 
       aes(x=reorder(variable, mic),y=mic, fill=variable)
       ) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity') + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("Variable Importance (based on MIC)") + 
  guides(fill=FALSE)
   
```

Although it is recommended to run correlations among all variables in order to exclude correlated input features.

<br>

#### Practice advice for using `mine` 

If it lasts too much time to finish, consider taking a sample.
If the amount of data is too little, consider setting a higher number in `alpha` parameter, 0.6 is its default.
Also, it can be run in parallel, just setting `n.cores=3` in case you have 4 cores. A general good practice when running parallel processes, the extra core will be used by the operating system.

<br>


### But just MINE covers this?

No. We used only MINE suite, but there are other algortihms related to [mutual information](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Mutual_information). 
In R some of the packages are: [entropy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/entropy/entropy.pdf) and [infotheo](https://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/r-help/library/infotheo/html/mutinformation.html).

Package `funModeling` (from version 1.6.6) introduces the function `var_rank_info` which calculates several information theory metrics, as it was seen in section [Rank best features using information theory](#select_features_var_rank_info).

In **Python** mutual information can be calculated through scikit-learn, [here an example](stackoverflow.com/questions/20491028/optimal-way-to-compute-pairwise-mutual-information-using-numpy).

The concept transcends the tool.

<br>

#### Another correlation example (mutual information)

This time we'll use `infotheo` package, we need first to do a **data preparation** step, applying a `discretize` function (or binning) function present in the package. It converts every numerical variable into categorical based on equal frequency criteria. 

Next code will create the correlation matrix as we seen before, but based on the mutual information index. 

```{r correlation-matrix-information-theory, eval=FALSE, fig.cap="Correlation matrix"}
library(infotheo)
# discretizing every variable

Correlation score based on mutual information ranks relationships pretty similar to MIC, doesn’t it?

### Information Measures: A general perspective

Further than correlation, MIC or other information metric measure if there is a _functional relationship_. 

A high MIC value indicates that the relationship between the two variables can be explained by a function. Is
our job to find that function or predictive model.

This analysis is extended to n-variables, this book introduces another algorithm in the selecting best variables chapter. 

Some predictive models perform better than other, but if the relationship is absolutely noisy no matter how advance the algorithm is, it will end up in bad results.

### Conclussions

Anscombe's quartet taught us the good practice of getting the _raw statistic_ together with a plot.

We could see how **noise** can affect the relationship between two variables, and this phenomenon always appears in data. Noise in data confuses the predictive model. 

Noise is related to error, and it can be studied with measures based on information theory such as 
**mutual information** and **maximal information coefficient**, which go one further step than typical R squared. There is a clinical study which uses MINE as feature selector in [@Caban2012].

These methods are applicable in **feature engineering** as a method which does not rely on a predictive model to rank most important variables. Also applicable to cluster time series.
